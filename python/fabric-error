/*
  Error during deployment using python fabric
*/

Error:
	No handlers could be found for logger paramiko

Solution:
	Most of the time, it complains for conflicting public keys. there could be some other reasons too. based on solutions; i used:

	If any of these are installed:	
	- pip uninstall paramiko
	- pip uninstall fabric
	- pip uninstall cryptography

	Reinstall:
	- pip install paramiko
	- pip install fabric
	- pip install crpytopgraphy (it might have installed with fabric package, just be sure)
	- pip install paramiko --upgrade
	- pip install fabric --upgrade

Reboot system. Hopefully, it should help.
Cheers!
