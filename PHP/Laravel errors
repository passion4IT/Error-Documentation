### Laravel dusk error:
- DuskServiceProvider missing:
   - Error: The currently authenticated user is not who was expected.
            Failed asserting that null is identical to Array &0 (
                'id' => 3
                'className' => 'App\User'
            ).
   - solution: Go to `app\Providers\AppServiceProvider.php`
     and add `use Laravel\Dusk\DuskServiceProvider;`
     public function register()
    {
        if ($this->app->environment('local', 'testing')) {
            $this->app->register(DuskServiceProvider::class);
        }
    }
